## Happy New Year

I realize it's been a long time since I last posted, and I wanted to start the new
year off right with a good post based on an experience I encountered. I'll try to
post sort of regularly going forward. Hope this post will yield useful insight!

## A Friendly Recap

When working with databases, it's a common need to repeatedly access data
through complex `SELECT` queries. Most RDBMS offer convenient ways to accomplish this:
_views_ and _materialized views_. Let's go over the differences between the two,
and when to use them.

### Views

A _view_ is essentially a stored query that, for all intents and purposes, can be
treated as a "regular" table. You, as the developer, define a query that gets executed
every time the view is accessed. This means that the data that comes back is always
fresh and reflects changes made to the tables within. In practice, especially when
operating on large datasets, you will learn that this is quite expensive since the
underlying query gets executed every single time.

Imagine a table called `t_orders` that tracks the sales of an ecommerce site:

<div class="tbl overflow-x-auto">
  <table class="db-tbl border-collapse border border-gray-200 text-subText">
    <thead>
      <tr class="bg-gray-100">
        <th class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-left font-bold">id</th>
        <th class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-left font-bold">
          customer_id
        </th>
        <th class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-left font-bold">
          order_date
        </th>
        <th class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 text-left font-bold">
          total_amount
        </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">1</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">1</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2024-11-01</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">$150.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="bg-gray-50">
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2024-11-02</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">$200.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">3</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">3</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2024-11-03</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">$50.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="bg-gray-50">
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">4</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">1</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2024-11-03</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">$300.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">5</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">2024-11-04</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300">$100.00</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

We could create a standard view based on this data called `vw_customer_orders` that
calculates the total price of all orders a customer has made:

```sql title="vw_customer_orders.sql" {1-2}#point
  DROP VIEW IF EXISTS vw_customer_orders;
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_customer_orders AS
  SELECT
      customer_id,
      COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
      SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
  FROM
    t_orders
  GROUP BY
    customer_id;
```

<InfoBox boxText = "Be mindful when replacing views as it may break dependent entities such as stored procedures or other views."/>

### Materialized Views

This is where _materialized views_ come in handy. The database does not need to recalculate
the results during each query since the query results are instead stored on disk, making
them **much faster to query**. However, there is one caveat -- the data in these views,
as compared to standard views, don't automatically update even if the underlying table data
changes. That means the materialized view can become outdated, forcing the user to manually
refresh the view. Manual refreshes are not feasible for any system.

```sql title="mv_customer_orders.sql" {1-2}#add
  DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_customer_orders;
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_customer_orders AS
  SELECT
      customer_id,
      COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
      SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
  FROM
    t_orders
  GROUP BY
    customer_id;
```

#### Standard Refresh

So, how do you keep materialized views, such as the one above, up to date? You can use the
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command to recalculate and reload the data. Rather than executing
this command manually, a scheduler that runs every _m_ minutes could potentially do this for you.
Below is a snippet of what this looks like in a Spring Boot application.

```java title="MVRefreshScheduler.java" {13}#point
public class MVRefreshScheduler {
  @Autowired
  private UtilRepository utilRepository;

  @Scheduled(cron = "*/m * * * *")
  public void refreshMV() {
    if (!schedulerEnabled) {
      log.warn("MVRefreshScheduler not enabled");
      return;
    }

    try {
      utilRepository.callRefresh();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      log.error(e);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Uh-Oh!

However, we still run into a potential roadblock -- **this operation locks the materialized view
for the duration of the refresh**, which means users can't access anything that depends on that
view. I've encountered a scenario where clients accessing a certain screen triggers a deadlock
as the data that populates that screen depends on the materialized view. This spells trouble for
high-availability systems, but rest asssured, we will explore in this post what we can do to avoid
this particular pitfall.

<InfoBox boxText = "Remember that a refresh can occur once for a materialized view at any given time."/>

<Collapsible collapseTitle = "Aside: Identifying Deadlocks" customCss = " pl-[1.5rem] pt-5 text-sm">
    It would probably be useful to identify the locks from the DB itself. Below is a nifty little query that does exactly that:

    ```sql title="do_locks_exist.sql"
    SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT
        1
    FROM
        pg_stat_activity ps
        JOIN pg_locks pl on ps.pid = pl.pid
    WHERE
        pl.relation = 'schema.my_table'::regclass
        AND NOT pl.granted
        AND ps.datname = current_database();
    );
    ```
</Collapsible>

## The "Hack"

The query alone obviously isn't helpful, so we can "hack" a solution - something that I quickly
cobbled up together to patch this issue. All that needs to be done is to duplicate the view and
treat the duplicate as a backup in case the primary view fails. Now here me out -- this is far
from the ideal solution -- but it works to a good extent. At the time, we settled for this work-around
as upgrades on our servers were interfering with our judgement. Hence, we settled for the most basic approach.

With this approach, one need simply check if there exists a lock on the view. The implementation of
the `doesViewContainLock()` method is given above.

```java title="MVRefreshScheduler.java" {13}#remove {14-18}#add
public class MVRefreshScheduler {
  @Autowired
  private UtilRepository utilRepository;

  @Scheduled(cron = "*/m * * * *")
  public void refreshMV() {
    if (!schedulerEnabled) {
      log.warn("MVRefreshScheduler not enabled");
      return;
    }

    try {
      utilRepository.callRefresh();
      if (utilRepository.doesViewContainLock("schema.mv_primary")) {
        utilRepository.callRefreshBackup();
      } else {
        utilRepository.callRefreshPrimary();
      }
    } catch (Exception e) {
      log.error(e);
    }
  }
}
```

## Show Me The <em class = "font-serif">Real</em> Solution

What if I told you there was a way to access the materialized view while it was still being
refreshed? Postgres allows the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW [CONCURRENTLY]` option whose sole purpose
is to allow allow the materialized view to remain accessible for reads during the refresh process.
The single prerequisite is that the materialized view requires a `UNIQUE` index on it. You could even
schedule these refreshes just as we did the standard refresh.

<InfoBox boxText = "Concurrent refreshes will be faster than standard refreshes for a smaller record size but is in general slow since it requires more system resources to maintain consistency."/>

## Remarks

PostgreSQL's materialized views can really boost performance in applications that handle a
lot of data. But to get the most out of them, it's important to use the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED
VIEW [CONCURRENTLY]` command effectively. Even with automated solutions as described, (1) there
is still some overhead in maintaining the scheduler job, and (2) there will be stale data
between refreshes.
