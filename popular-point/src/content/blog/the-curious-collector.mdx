_"What watch should you add to your collection?" "What does my current collection need next?" "I'm so and so years old, and I have this amount of money. I'm trying to finish my collection. What watch should I get next?"_ These are the most often asked questions that come about when discussing about watch collecting. They stem from the notion that collecting watches is often viewed as a prerequisite of sorts — something that collectors feel is necessary to enjoy watches.

Truth be told, that is most certainly not the case at all. You can relish watches simply by owning and wearing one watch. You could also discover watches online. Try them on. Appreciate them for what they are. And the nice thing is you don't have to actually own a watch to even appreciate watches. But the vast majority of people will just purchase the watches that they like. Try them. Wear them. Then they eventually stumble upon another one they research and learn more about.

This is the way a collection kind of grows organically, with pieces that you connect with. Pieces that you actually admire. Because it's really by going through this — going through this process — learning what you do or don't like. All so that you will be able to grow yourself the "perfect" collection. This happens by finding what _you_ truly like and what _you_ need in a collection. As long as it has a field watch, a dress watch, and a dive watch. Just kidding. I'm not going to say that your collection should have this or that, nor should I. I'll leave it to you to explore what all options exist.
