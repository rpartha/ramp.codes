Hey there! Welcome to https://ramp.codes. We’re all about creating awesome content for you, and we want to be upfront about how we track views on our blog posts. Here’s the scoop:

<h2 class = "font-serif text-link">What We Track</h2>

When you check out our blog, we keep track of how many times each post is viewed. Here’s how we do it:

<ul
    class="mt-1 list-['–'] pl-4 pr-8 text-justify font-sans text-md leading-snug text-body sublist"
>
    <li class="pl-2 text-md">**_Local Storage_**: We store view counts in your browser to enhance your experience.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-[0.3rem]">**_Session Storage_**: This prevents multiple counts for the same post in a single session.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-[0.3rem]">**_Database_**: We maintain a permanent record of view counts for analysis, even if you come back later.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class = "font-serif text-link">Why We Track</h2>

Your data of course belongs to you! With that said, we use this data to:

<ul
    class="mt-1 list-['–'] pl-4 pr-8 text-justify font-sans text-md leading-snug text-body sublist"
>
    <li class="pl-2">Understand which posts are popular.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-[0.3rem]">Improve our content based on your preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class = "font-serif text-link">Data Retention</h2>

<ul
    class="mt-1 list-['–'] pl-4 pr-8 text-justify font-sans text-md leading-snug text-body sublist"
>
    <li class="pl-2">**_Local Storage_**: Your data stays until you clear your browser's storage.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-[0.3rem]">**_Session Storage_**: This clears when you close your browser tab.</li>
    <li class="pl-2 pt-[0.3rem]">**_Database_**: We keep view counts as long as we need them, and you can ask us to delete your data anytime.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class = "font-serif text-link">Changes to This Policy</h2>

For the forseeable future, we don't expect our policy to change. But in case it does, feel free to check back here.
